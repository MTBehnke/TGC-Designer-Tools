Shameless plug: I work primarily as a software consultant.  If you or your company need electronics, sensors, data processing, automation or robotics expertise, feel free to send inquiries to chad@chadev.com.  I'm part of a medium sized team and we've worked for many businesses you're familiar with, and we have a long history of success.

## Software Developer Installation

Currently targeting Python 3.7

Get the dependencies with:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Distribution

pyinstaller -F --add-binary="./laszip/laszip-cli.exe;laszip" --additional-hooks-dir="./PyInstaller/hooks/" tgc_gui.py

In some cases you may need to include paths to certain directories (e.g. using venv for IDE, but not for pyinstaller):
pyinstaller -F --clean --add-binary="./laszip/laszip-cli.exe;laszip" --additional-hooks-dir="./PyInstaller/hooks/" --paths="./venv/Lib/site-packages/" --paths="./venv/src/" --paths="./venv/src/laspy/" tgc_gui.py
